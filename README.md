# Watermark
My twelfth project at JBA 

Stage 5/5: No more restrictions
Description
In the final stage, we will lift the image requirements of sharing the dimensions! But for simplicity, limit the watermark image â€” it must be smaller or equal to the original image. The error message for different dimensions of two images isn't valid anymore, so a new one will be used, in case a dimension of the watermark image is larger than the original image dimension.

In this stage, we will put a single watermark logo or several as a grid. Take a look at some examples:


Top-left, Top-right and bottom-left

Bottom-right, in the middle and grid
If users want to place a single watermark, ask for its position. The position is denoted by two integer numbers (X for horizontal and Y for vertical) that are the number of pixels from the top-left corner. (0,0) is the initial position (see the Figure below). X is a value from 0 to <Image width - Watermark width>, and Y is a value from 0 to <Image height - Watermark height>:



The watermark pixels should be blended with the image pixels as in the previous stage. All other image pixels remain the same.

You may want to position the watermark as a grid. In this case, the watermark should be initially set at the top-left corner. Then repeat the watermark towards the right corner and the bottom until all space is covered.

Objectives
Compare the dimensions of the two images. If the watermark image has at least one dimension larger than the dimension of the original image, print The watermark's dimensions are larger. and terminate the program (Example 8);
Before asking users for the output image filename, ask for the position method with Choose the position method (single, grid):, and read the user input. If this input isn't single or grid, print The position method input is invalid. and terminate the program (Example 5);
If the user input is single, then print Input the watermark position ([x 0-DiffX] [y 0-DiffY]):, where DiffX is an integer equal to the subtraction <Image width - Watermark width>, and DiffY is an integer equal to the subtraction<Image height - Watermark height> (Examples 1 and 2). The position is two integers in the given range, separated by one space;
If the position input is correct, create the output image as described in the Description section (Examples 1 and 2);
If the position input isn't valid, print The position input is invalid. and terminate the program (Example 6);
If the input integers are out of range, print The position input is out of range. and terminate the program (Example 7);
If the user input is grid, create the output image as described in the Description section (Examples 3 and 4).
If you need some image files to experiment with your code for stage 5, then you can download this zip file.
